## üéÆ Block Types & Properties

### Start Block
**Purpose**: Entry point for the game flow
- **Title**: Game introduction name
- **Description**: Welcome message for players
- **Starting Health**: Initial player health (1-1000)
- **Starting Gold**: Initial player currency (0-10000)
- **Difficulty**: Game difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)

**Rationale**: These properties establish the foundation of the player's journey, providing clear starting conditions and setting expectations for the adventure ahead.

### Choice Block
**Purpose**: Player decision points with branching narratives
- **Question**: The decision prompt presented to players
- **Option A & B**: Available choices for the player
- **Consequence A & B**: Outcomes of each choice

**Rationale**: Choice blocks are the heart of interactive storytelling. These properties enable meaningful branching narratives where player decisions have clear consequences, creating engagement and replayability.

### Enemy Block
**Purpose**: Combat encounters with strategic depth
- **Name**: Enemy identification
- **Health**: Enemy durability (1-1000)
- **Attack**: Enemy damage output (1-100)
- **Defense**: Enemy damage reduction (0-100)
- **Gold Reward**: Currency gained from victory (0-1000)
- **Experience Points**: Progression points earned (0-500)

**Rationale**: Combat encounters need balanced mechanics. These properties create strategic depth where players must consider risk vs. reward, while providing clear progression incentives through gold and experience.

### Treasure Block
**Purpose**: Rewards and loot discovery
- **Name**: Treasure identification
- **Value**: Base treasure worth (1-10000)
- **Type**: Reward category (Gold/Item/Experience/Weapon/Armor)
- **Rarity**: Drop frequency (Common/Rare/Epic/Legendary)
- **Description**: Treasure details and lore

**Rationale**: Treasure systems drive player motivation and progression. The rarity system creates excitement and replay value, while different types provide varied rewards that enhance different aspects of gameplay.

### End Block
**Purpose**: Adventure conclusions with multiple outcomes
- **Title**: Ending identification
- **Ending Type**: Outcome category (Success/Failure/Neutral)
- **Message**: Conclusion message for players
- **Final Score**: End-game scoring system (0-10000)
- **Unlock Condition**: Optional requirement for special endings

**Rationale**: Endings provide closure and satisfaction. Multiple ending types create replayability, while scoring systems enable comparison and achievement hunting.

## ‚úÖ Validation Rules

### Required Rules
1. **Start Block Requirement**: Flow must have exactly one Start block
2. **End Block Requirement**: Flow must have at least one End block
3. **Choice Output Requirement**: Choice blocks must have 2+ outputs
4. **Enemy Connection Rule**: Enemy blocks must connect to Treasure or End blocks

### Custom Rule: Enemy Connection Requirement
**Rule**: Enemy blocks must connect to at least one Treasure or End block.

**Rationale**: In game design, combat encounters should lead to meaningful outcomes. An enemy represents a challenge, and overcoming that challenge should either reward the player (treasure) or advance the narrative toward conclusion (end). This prevents "dead-end" enemy encounters that offer no progression or reward, which can be frustrating for players. It ensures every combat encounter serves a purpose within the game flow, balancing simplicity with depth.

### Additional Validations
- **Orphaned Nodes**: Warning for disconnected blocks
- **Circular Connections**: Warning for potential infinite loops
- **Multiple Start Blocks**: Warning for multiple entry points

## üìä Computation Panel: Total Adventure Score

### What We Compute
Instead of simple "treasure points," we calculate a comprehensive **Total Adventure Score** that evaluates multiple aspects of game design quality.

### Score Formula
```
Total Adventure Score = 
  (Treasure Value √ó 1.0) +
  (Enemy Rewards √ó 0.8) +
  (Experience √ó 0.5) +
  (Path Complexity √ó 10) +
  (Difficulty √ó 20) -
  (Risk-Reward Penalty if < 0.5)
```

### Why This Choice
1. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Considers treasure value, enemy rewards, experience, complexity, and difficulty
2. **Game Design Relevance**: Reflects real game design principles and player engagement factors
3. **Actionable Insights**: Provides grade system (A+ to F), detailed breakdown, and smart recommendations
4. **Risk-Reward Analysis**: Evaluates if rewards match challenge level for balanced gameplay

### Additional Metrics
- **Treasure Value**: Sum with rarity multipliers (Common=1x, Rare=1.5x, Epic=2x, Legendary=3x)
- **Enemy Rewards**: Gold + experience converted to equivalent value
- **Experience Points**: Cumulative XP from all enemies
- **Path Complexity**: Measures branching and narrative depth
- **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Evaluates challenge vs. reward balance
- **Estimated Play Time**: Calculated based on content density
